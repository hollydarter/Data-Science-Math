GitHub Markdown, often referred to as "GitHub Flavored Markdown" or GFM, is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text on GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and other GitHub-related content. Markdown is easy to learn and widely used for creating documentation, README files, and comments on GitHub. Here are some common GitHub Markdown syntax and formatting options:

### Headers

You can create headers using `#`:

```markdown
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
```

### Emphasis

You can make text bold by enclosing it in double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__`, and you can italicize text using single asterisks `*` or single underscores `_`:

```markdown
**Bold Text** or __Bold Text__
*Italic Text* or _Italic Text_
```

### Lists

You can create ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists:

#### Ordered List

```markdown
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
```

#### Unordered List

```markdown
- Item A
- Item B
- Item C
```

### Links

You can create links using `[text](URL)`:

```markdown
[OpenAI](https://www.openai.com)
```

### Images

You can embed images using `![alt text](URL)`:

```markdown
![GitHub Logo](https://github.com/logos/github-logo.png)
```

### Code Blocks

You can create inline code using backticks \`code\`, and you can create code blocks by surrounding the code with triple backticks:

Inline code: `print("Hello, World!")`

Code block:

```markdown
```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
```

You can also specify the programming language after the triple backticks for syntax highlighting.

### Blockquotes

You can create blockquotes using `>`:

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
```

### Horizontal Rules

You can create horizontal lines using three or more dashes `---`, asterisks `***`, or underscores `___`:

```markdown
---
```

### Tables

You can create tables using pipes `|` and hyphens `-` to separate columns and headers:

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |
```

### Task Lists

You can create task lists for checkboxes using `- [ ]` (unchecked) and `- [x]` (checked):

```markdown
- [x] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3
```

### Mentioning Users and Issues

You can mention users or link to issues and pull requests using `@`:

```markdown
@username mentioned in this issue.
```

### Emoji

You can use emoji by surrounding the emoji code with colons `:smile:`:

```markdown
:smile: :thumbsup:
```

These are some of the basic formatting options available in GitHub Markdown. GitHub also supports more advanced features such as referencing issues and pull requests, creating tables of contents, and using LaTeX math notation for equations. You can refer to GitHub's official documentation for more details: [GitHub Markdown Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
