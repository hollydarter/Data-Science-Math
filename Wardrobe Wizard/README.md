# What is Alexnet and How do we Use It?
Wardrobe Wizard integrates AlexNet, a pioneering convolutional neural network, to elevate the accuracy of our image classification. Developed in 2012, AlexNet excels in discerning intricate patterns and features within images.Think of AlexNet as your wardrobe's style detective. With a vast collection of clothing photos, its job is to swiftly sort them into two categories: shirts and pants. It's the key to making your wardrobe organization quick, precise, and hassle-free. 
## Why AlexNet Matters:
- *Image Classification:* AlexNet is the backbone of our algorithm, precisely distinguishing between shirts and pants in your clothing photos.
- *Feature Extraction:* Its convolutional layers help to accurately distinguish the differences between clothing items.
